        <h1 class="grid-item item2">About Me</h1>
        <p class="grid-item item3">Hi! My name is Srihitha. I'm a freshman at UC Berkeley, hoping to major in computer science and minor in creative writing. 
        I'm really passionate about the intersection between technology, storytelling, and social good.
        In my free time, I enjoy volunteering with the Student Food Collective and teaching/mentoring. 
        I also love reading, writing—trying to get working on my first novel, baking, cooking, hiking, and restaurant hunting. 
        I'm infamously known for using way too many exclamation points in my sentences—there was a lot of self control required in writing this paragraph.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h4>In my junior year of high school, I began contemplating the pervasive nature of gender bias within the literary world—novels, textbooks, stories, etc. Under the careful guidance of a mentor, I worked to develop a tool that could detect the percentages of gender bias in text, with the goal of helping writers mitigate bias in their work and enabling readers to be more aware while consuming literature. Working on this project was an invigorating, empowering experience, one that showed me how through technology, I could work towards balancing the literary landscape with fair, unbiased literature.</h4>

    <h4>Under the guidance of my Girls Write Now mentor Yvette Clark, I crafted a piece of poetic prose about complex mother-daughter relationships and cycles of domestic abuse and gendered violence within South Asian communities. I had the opportunity to be featured in Girls Write Now Live: Unmuted—a video series showcasing mentees' work.</h4>
